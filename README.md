The model will integrate Gradient Boosting Classifier and Random Forest Classifier using algorithms like Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, and ensemble approaches after being trained on a relevant dataset that contains information on changes in speaking patterns. Accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score metrics will be used to assess the performance of the machine learning model. The initiative has the potential to increase the speed and accuracy of Parkinson's disease diagnoses.
